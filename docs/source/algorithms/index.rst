Algorithms
==========


AMLGym provides seamless integration with state-of-the-art algorithms
for offline learning classical planning domains from an input set of
trajectories in the following settings:
1. **full** observability: SAM [1].
2. **partial** observability: OffLAM [2].
3. **full** and **noisy** observability: NOLAM [3], ROSAME [4].
